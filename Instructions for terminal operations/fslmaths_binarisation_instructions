#Need to create a folder outside of the current one which you should be cd'd into called binarised (or whatever dummy name).

Then use the following command in the terminal:

for file in ./*nii.gz; do fslmaths $(basename $file) -add 1 -uthr 1.1 -mul -1 -add 1 ./binarised/$(basename $file) -odt int; done


This is assumed to only be applied to nii.gz file type images.
